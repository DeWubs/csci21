notes from class
were starting with the stl linked list,
list created outside of the the class it will encapsulate it as a node
think it as a box that holds the stuff in the class, also holds next.
a->c->m
^      ^
head   tail
head points to null if there is nothing in the list
"basically making a list, its legitimatley what its doing..."
example list pesudo cody
lis <contacts>myContacts;
push_back(a);
        (b);
        (m);
myContacts.insert(it, b);// "it" is an itterator i think, its just its name?...

what's a queue?
its a waithing list first in first out, not nececcarily ordered. always add at the tail
always remove things from the front.
what is a stack
adds to the end and removes from the end, just like a stack of pancakes. its the way that all computers
work.
nodes are like objects of the same data type.
node e{list<contacts> myContacts
