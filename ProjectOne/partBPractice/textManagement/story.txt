    A long time ago in a not so diferent world a little boy by the name of tommy embarked on an adventure of grandure,
tommy appeared rather plain, he spoke and dressed no different from anyone else, but his mind was always in the clouds.
Some days tommy would be fighting dragons and saving villages, other days he would be a master chef in paris cooking for
royalty. whatever his adventure was he always was home for supper.
