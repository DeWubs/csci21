a bug was encountered that said that monsterName() was not in the class Monster 
    i then realized that the function was not prototyped in the class so i added it
    likewise with describe()
a bug that was saying monsterName() was not declared in class
    after being confused for a moment i realized that i spelled it wrong in the prototype i corrected that error
    and the program compiled.
a bug where my age variable was saying it wasnt declared
    i had it set to string by accedent
