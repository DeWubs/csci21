    when working properly the code will take in commands from the user and track their attacks onto a board, the computer will make its decisions after the player based on an algorithm
    that checks it's neighbors and diaplay it's attacks on a seperate board as well.

i have tested various numbers outside of the options shown (1-3) to see if it would do something, it handled it correctly 
and prompted the user to put in a number 1-3
pressing 1 correctly shows the board and it sets the humans tracking board
pressing 2 correctly prompts the user for an attack and displays the tracking board and correctly handles inputs 1-100 and
replaces positions with H or M depending on if it were a hit or not.
case 3 correctly ends the program

inputs for the attack commands are not robust, but if arguments passed are within the parameters the program proceeds as it should, the computer's turn appears to exicute the 
algorithm and it uses the queue appropriatley.

for these reasons i belive that my code works.
