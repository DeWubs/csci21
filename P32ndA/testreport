with my word list i mainly wanted to test the prefix a, because it was easy to slap together a couple words starting with a.
my list of words had several words starting with the letter a, i even mixed them up and put them in non-numerical order
the output of my program was
enter a prefix: a
a
and
are
at
as

it put them in the correct order, and that is why i am convinced that this works.
